Game Description : Additional software requirements At the beginning of the game, 
the game software randomly generates 5 numbers in the range of 10000 to 20000, but those that are initially divisible by both 3 and 2.
The human-player chooses which of the generated numbers he wants to start the game with.

Game description At the beginning of the game, the number chosen by the human-player is given.
Both players have 0 points. In addition, the game uses a game bank, which is initially equal to 0. 
Players make consecutive moves, dividing the current number by 2 or 3 in each move. The number can be divided only
if the result is a whole number. If division by 2 is done, then 2 points are added to the opponent's score. 
If division by 3 is done, then 3 points are added to the player's own score. On the other hand, if a number ending with 0 or 5 is obtained,
then 1 point is added to the bank. The game ends when a number less than or equal to 10 has just been acquired. The player whose 
turn ends the game empties the bank by adding bank points to his points. 
If the players have the same number of points, the result is a draw. Otherwise, the player with the higher number of points wins.
